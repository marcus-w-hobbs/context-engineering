# Case Studies

Real-world applications of context engineering methodology.

## Available Case Studies

### [four-apps-six-months.md](./four-apps-six-months.md)

How context engineering methodology evolved across four production applications:

| Project | Timeline | Key Innovation |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| App 1 | 6 weeks | Discovered the human bottleneck |
| App 2 | 2 weeks | Browser automation for agents |
| App 3 | 2 weeks | CLAUDE.md as comprehensive constitution |
| App 4 | Ongoing | Design system with Figma sync |

Each project built on the previous, with learnings compounding into faster delivery.

## The Pattern

Every case study follows the same arc:

1. **The Problem** — What wasn't working
2. **The Innovation** — What we tried
3. **The Learning** — What we extracted
4. **The Result** — How it affected velocity

The goal isn't to show perfect projects, but to show the evolution of understanding.
